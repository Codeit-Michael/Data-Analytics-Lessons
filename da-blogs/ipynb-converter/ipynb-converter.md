# Converting ".ipynb" Files to Other File Format

I love using Jupyter Notebook especially when I'm learning something new with Python. Aside from using it with Pandas, it allows me to quickly document my learnings, whereas I can take notes and write and run codes in the same file. There are times I publish these notes into blogs, so I have to convert these `.ipynb` files into `.md` files, and it is a real hassle to transfer them into another file line-by-line. So, I got curious and searched for a Python module for converting `.ipynb` files into other file types, and lucky there is a module for this job. It is called `nbconvert` module and if you don't know about this yet, here's a quick guide to using it.


## Install Jupyter nbconvert (if you haven't already):
You can install `nbconvert` using `pip`:
```bash
pip install nbconvert
```

## Convert .ipynb to .md:
You can convert a `.ipynb` file to `.md` using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown your_notebook.ipynb
```
Replace `your_notebook.ipynb` with the actual name of your Jupyter Notebook file. This command will create a Markdown file with the same name as your notebook but with the `.md` extension.

## Converting to other formats:
The `nbconvert` library supports converting Jupyter Notebooks to various formats, including HTML, PDF, LaTeX, and more. To convert to a different format, replace `--to markdown` with the format of your choice. For example:

HTML: `--to html`
PDF: `--to pdf`
LaTeX: `--to latex`
You can specify the output file name using the `--output` option, followed by the desired file name and extension.

Here's an example command to convert a `.ipynb` file to HTML:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html your_notebook.ipynb
```

These commands will generate the respective output files in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook. And that's how you can easily convert a `.ipynb` file into another file format.
